# Storage Class

The implementation of dynamic volume provisioning is based on the API object `StorageClass` from the API group `storage.k8s.io`. A cluster administrator can define as many `StorageClass` objects as needed, each specifying a volume plugin (aka provisioner) that provisions a volume and the set of parameters to pass to that provisioner when provisioning. A cluster administrator can define and expose multiple flavors of storage (from the same or different storage systems) within a cluster, each with a custom set of parameters. This design also ensures that end users donâ€™t have to worry about the complexity and nuances of how storage is provisioned, but still have the ability to select from multiple storage options.

To enable dynamic provisioning, a cluster administrator needs to pre-create one or more StorageClass objects for users. StorageClass objects define which provisioner should be used and what parameters should be passed to that provisioner when dynamic provisioning is invoked.

The following manifest creates a storage class `fast` which provisions SSD-like persistent disks.

```
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
```

## Using Dynamic Provisioning

Users request dynamically provisioned storage by including a storage class in their `PersistentVolumeClaim`. Before Kubernetes v1.6, this was done via the `volume.beta.kubernetes.io/storage-class` annotation. However, this annotation is deprecated since v1.6. Users now can and should instead use the `storageClassName` field of the `PersistentVolumeClaim` object. The value of this field must match the name of a `StorageClass` configured by the administrator.

To select the `fast` storage class, for example, a user would create the following `PersistentVolumeClaim`:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: claim1
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  storageClassName: fast
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 30Gi
```

This claim results in an SSD-like Persistent Disk being automatically provisioned. When the claim is deleted, the volume is destroyed.
